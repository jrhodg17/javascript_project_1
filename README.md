### Technologies
Plain old, vanilla Javascript is pretty much it! You'll need to know how to use the Command Line Interface as well.

### Setup 
1. You'll need Node.js installed on your computer or virtual environment to run this program. [Link to Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Download Node.js")
2. Create a folder / directory on your computer. Change directory into that folder in the Terminal / PowerShell / etc. Create a JS file - called "main.js" or "script.js" or whatever you like. Copy and Paste the contents of my "main.js" file into your file. Save. 
3. Type ```node filename``` in the Terminal to run the program!<br><br>*Note:* ```filename``` *refers to the actual name of your file - be it "main.js", "script.js" or whatever else you may have chosen.*
